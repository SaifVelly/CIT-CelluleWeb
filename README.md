Projects

To solidify your understanding and apply your skills, we will work on the following projects:

    Blog web project : Create a blog web project for a better understanding of the CRUD operations.
    To-Do List App: Create a web application to manage tasks. (In this case the data will be stored using MongoDB int his case)


Happy Coding!
